# ``UIViewControllerPresenting``

A library that allows you to present UIKit or SwiftUI views from an existing SwiftUI view using UIKit presentation APIs.

## Overview

`UIViewControllerPresenting` provides a framework for wrapping existing UIKit views and presenting them from a SwiftUI view using a similar API to the native SwiftUI `.sheet` APIs. It is ideal for presenting built-in UIKit view controllers but can also be used for presenting your own custom UIKit controllers or even presenting another SwiftUI view using UIKit presentation features such as sheet detents.
